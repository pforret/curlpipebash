The `php.new` macOS installer is a compact 212-line script that sets up a ready-to-go PHP development environment via `curl -sL https://php.new/install/mac | bash`. It downloads pre-built binaries for PHP 8.5, Composer, and the Laravel installer from `download.herdphp.com` — the infrastructure behind Laravel Herd — and drops them into `~/.config/herd-lite/bin/`. It also fetches the Mozilla CA certificate bundle from `curl.se`, creates a minimal `php.ini`, wires `PATH` and `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` into your shell profile, and generates its own uninstall script. The whole thing is essentially "Herd Lite": a standalone subset of Laravel Herd that skips the GUI and gives you three executables and a config directory.

## What does it change?

### Files and folders

- Creates `~/.config/herd-lite/bin/` and populates it with five files: `php`, `composer`, `laravel`, `cacert.pem`, and `php.ini`
- Creates `~/.config/herd-lite/bin/uninstall_herd_lite` — a self-contained uninstall script that removes the entire `herd-lite` directory
- All downloaded binaries (`php`, `composer`, `laravel`, `uninstall_herd_lite`) are `chmod +x`'d after download

### Downloads

- PHP binary: `https://download.herdphp.com/herd-lite/macos/arm64/8.5/php` (Apple Silicon) or `https://download.herdphp.com/herd-lite/macos/x64/8.5/php` (Intel) — selected via `uname -m`
- Composer: `https://download.herdphp.com/herd-lite/composer`
- Laravel installer: `https://download.herdphp.com/resources/laravel`
- CA certificate bundle: `https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem`

### Environment changes

- Appends `export PATH="~/.config/herd-lite/bin:$PATH"` and `export PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR="~/.config/herd-lite/bin:$PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR"` to the first matching shell profile file
- For bash: checks `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile` in order
- For zsh: checks `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.profile` in order
- Skips the PATH update if `~/.config/herd-lite/bin` is already present in `$PATH`
- Creates `php.ini` with three directives: `curl.cainfo` and `openssl.cafile` pointing to the downloaded `cacert.pem`, and `pcre.jit=0`

### Permissions

- The script checks for an existing Laravel Herd installation at `~/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin/php` and prompts for confirmation before proceeding
- No `sudo` is used — everything installs into the user's home directory

## Uninstall

The script generates its own uninstall script. Run it:

```bash
~/.config/herd-lite/bin/uninstall_herd_lite
```

This removes the entire `~/.config/herd-lite/bin/` directory. You'll also want to remove the PATH entries from your shell profile:

```bash
# Remove the two export lines added by php.new
# Check whichever file was modified: ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, etc.
grep -n "herd-lite" ~/.zshrc
# Then edit the file to remove those lines
```
