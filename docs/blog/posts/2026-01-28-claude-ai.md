The Claude Code installer is a compact 149-line bootstrap script invoked via `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`. It downloads a platform-specific `claude` binary from a GCS bucket, verifies its SHA-256 checksum against a version manifest, then delegates the real setup to `claude install` — which handles the launcher binary and shell integration — and deletes the downloaded file afterward. The script is a two-stage bootstrapper: it does just enough to securely fetch a verified binary and hands off all persistent installation to that binary. It includes a pure-bash JSON parser as a fallback for extracting checksums when `jq` is not available, and detects musl libc on Linux to select the correct binary variant.

## What does it change?

### Files and folders

- Creates `~/.claude/downloads/` for the temporary binary download
- Downloads the `claude` binary to `~/.claude/downloads/claude-<version>-<platform>` — this file is deleted after installation completes
- The real persistent installation (launcher binary, shell integration) is performed by `claude install`, which the script invokes on the downloaded binary at line 142. The bootstrap script itself leaves no permanent files behind.

### Downloads

- Fetches the latest version string from `https://storage.googleapis.com/claude-code-dist-.../claude-code-releases/latest`
- Fetches `manifest.json` for the resolved version, which contains per-platform SHA-256 checksums
- Downloads the platform-specific `claude` binary from the same GCS bucket
- All downloads use `curl` (preferred) or `wget` as fallback; the `download_file()` function wraps both

### Permissions

- Sets the downloaded binary as executable (`chmod +x`) before running `claude install`

## Uninstall

The bootstrap script itself is stateless — it cleans up its download automatically. To remove the installed Claude Code CLI, run:

```bash
claude uninstall
```

If the `claude` command is no longer available, remove the installation directory manually:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude
```

Check your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) for any sourcing lines added by `claude install` and remove them.
