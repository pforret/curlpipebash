Ever wished you could install bash scripts as easily as you install npm packages? That's exactly what basher does — it's a package manager for shell scripts! This tiny installer (just 62 lines) clones basher to your home directory and wires it into your shell's startup script, so you can start `basher install`-ing community scripts right away.

## What does it change?

### Files and folders

The script creates a single new folder in your home directory:

- `~/.basher/` — the entire basher installation lives here, cloned straight from GitHub

It also modifies one of your shell startup files (depending on which shell you use):

- **bash**: appends two lines to `~/.bashrc`
- **zsh**: appends two lines to `~/.zshrc`
- **sh**: appends two lines to `~/.profile`
- **fish**: appends five lines to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

The clever bit? Every line it adds is tagged with `##basher5ea843` — a marker that makes cleanup a breeze later.

### Downloads

- Clones `https://github.com/basherpm/basher.git` to `~/.basher`

This is a git clone, so you'll get the full repository including git history. On the plus side: easy updates with `git pull`!

### Environment changes

The installer adds basher to your PATH and initializes it on every new shell session:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.basher/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(basher init - bash)"  # or zsh, sh, fish
```

This means `basher` will be available in every new terminal window you open after installation.

### Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have:

- **git** installed (the script checks for this and bails if it's missing)
- One of the supported shells: bash, zsh, sh, or fish

The script is also polite enough to refuse installation if basher is already present in `~/.basher` or the XDG data directory.

## Changed your mind?

No hard feelings! Here's how to cleanly remove basher:

1. **Delete the basher directory**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.basher
   ```

2. **Clean up your shell startup file** — open your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`, or fish config and remove any lines containing `##basher5ea843`. There should be 2-5 lines depending on your shell.

   For bash/zsh/sh, you can do this automatically:
   ```bash
   # For bash
   sed -i.bak '/basher5ea843/d' ~/.bashrc

   # For zsh
   sed -i.bak '/basher5ea843/d' ~/.zshrc

   # For fish
   sed -i.bak '/basher5ea843/d' ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```

3. **Start a fresh terminal** — or `source` your startup file to clear basher from your current session's PATH.

That's it! Your system is back to its pre-basher state.
