The basher installer is a minimal 61-line bash script that installs [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher), a package manager for shell scripts, via `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basherpm/basher/master/install.sh | bash`. It git-clones the basher repository into `~/.basher` and appends initialization lines to the user's shell profile. Zero boilerplate — no colors, no banners, no spinners. Every line appended to the shell profile is tagged with the marker `##basher5ea843`, making it trivial to grep and remove them on uninstall. The script supports bash, zsh, sh, and fish, with fish getting its own 5-line initialization block.

## What does it change?

### Files and folders

- Clones the basher repository into `~/.basher` via `git clone https://github.com/basherpm/basher.git ~/.basher`
- Checks for an existing installation at both `~/.basher` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/basher` (defaults to `~/.local/share/basher`) and aborts if either exists

### Downloads

- The entire basher repository from `https://github.com/basherpm/basher.git` (via git clone)

### Environment changes

Appends initialization lines to the shell's startup script, selected by `$SHELL`:

- **bash:** appends to `~/.bashrc`
- **zsh:** appends to `~/.zshrc`
- **sh:** appends to `~/.profile`
- **fish:** appends to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

For bash/zsh/sh, two lines are added:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.basher/bin:$PATH"   ##basher5ea843
eval "$(basher init - bash)"             ##basher5ea843
```

For fish, five lines are added:

```fish
if test -d ~/.basher          ##basher5ea843
  set basher ~/.basher/bin    ##basher5ea843
end                           ##basher5ea843
set -gx PATH $basher $PATH    ##basher5ea843
status --is-interactive; and . (basher init - fish | psub)    ##basher5ea843
```

Every appended line is tagged with `##basher5ea843` to enable clean removal. The script requires the startup file to already exist — it aborts if the profile file is missing rather than creating one.

## Uninstall

Remove the basher directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.basher
```

Remove the tagged lines from your shell profile:

```bash
# For bash:
grep -v "basher5ea843" ~/.bashrc > ~/.bashrc.tmp && mv ~/.bashrc.tmp ~/.bashrc

# For zsh:
grep -v "basher5ea843" ~/.zshrc > ~/.zshrc.tmp && mv ~/.zshrc.tmp ~/.zshrc

# For fish:
grep -v "basher5ea843" ~/.config/fish/config.fish > ~/.config/fish/config.fish.tmp && mv ~/.config/fish/config.fish.tmp ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

No system-level changes, packages, or services need to be reversed.
