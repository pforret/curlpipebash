# About this site

## What is curlpipebash.com?

**curlpipebash.com** is a documentation site that catalogs, analyzes and documents `curl | bash` installation scripts used by popular open-source projects. Many well-known tools -- Docker, Homebrew, nvm, Laravel and others -- offer a one-liner like this as their recommended installation method:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/install.sh | bash
```

This site downloads those scripts, runs code analysis on them, and presents the results in a readable format so you can see exactly what each script does before you run it.

## What you'll find here

Each **example page** includes:

- **The curl command** needed to run the script
- **A description** of what the script installs
- **A reference link** to the project's official documentation
- **Code statistics** generated by [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) (lines of code, comments, blank lines)
- **The full source code** of the script, so you can read it before piping it to bash

The site also has a **blog** section with posts about newly analyzed scripts and observations about the `curl | bash` pattern in the wild.

## Why does this site exist?

The `curl | bash` pattern is both convenient and controversial. It lets you install software with a single command, but it also means you're piping code from the internet directly into your shell. That requires trust.

This site exists to make that trust more informed. By presenting the full source code and statistics for each script, it lets you:

- **Inspect before you install** -- read the actual code a script will execute
- **Compare approaches** -- see how different projects structure their installers
- **Understand the scope** -- check how many lines of code you're about to run and in what languages

## Projects covered

The site currently includes installation scripts from projects such as:

| Project                  | URL                    | What it installs          |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Docker**               | `get.docker.com`       | Docker Engine             |
| **Homebrew**             | `brew.sh`              | macOS package manager     |
| **nvm**                  | `nvm-sh/nvm`           | Node Version Manager      |
| **Laravel**              | `laravel.build`        | Docker-based Laravel app  |
| **FrankenPHP**           | `frankenphp.dev`       | FrankenPHP server         |
| **basher**               | `basherpm/basher`      | Bash package manager      |

New scripts are added regularly -- check the [blog](../blog/index.md) for the latest additions.

## How it's built

The site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfundamentals.com/mkdocs-material/) theme. The example pages are generated automatically by a custom bash script (`curlbash.sh`) built on the [bashew](https://github.com/pforret/bashew) framework. The generation pipeline:

1. Downloads the installation script via `curl`
2. Runs `cloc` to produce code statistics
3. Wraps everything into a structured Markdown page
4. MkDocs renders the final HTML

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
